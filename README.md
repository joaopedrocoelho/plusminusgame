A classroom game to be used with interactive whiteboards. The students can choose cells that contain math symbols '+' , '-' , 'x' and 'รท' (defined in the settings).
Players will win or lose points according to the row that the symbol is in, so a '+' sign in row 5 will award the team 5 points, a 'รท' in row 2 will divide the points by two.
